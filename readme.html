<h2>ASP.NET Identity Azure Table StorageProvider</h2>

<p>The project is an implementation of <code>Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Core</code> for storing user and role information in an Azure table.</p>

<p>This is still in early development, so don't expect it to work perfectly.  I'll be using this in another project that is undergoing concurrent development, so updates will be forthcoming.</p>

<p><strong>Please note!</strong> Unit tests depend on you having the <em>latest version</em> of the storage emulator installed.  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2014/01/16/windows-azure-storage-emulator-2-2-1-preview-release-with-support-for-2013-08-15-version.aspx">This is currently in beta.</a></p>
