##ASP.NET Identity Azure Table StorageProvider

The project is an implementation of `Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Core` for storing user and role information in an Azure table.

This is still in early development, so don't expect it to work perfectly.  I'll be using this in another project that is undergoing concurrent development, so updates will be forthcoming.

**Please note!** Unit tests depend on you having the *latest version* of the storage emulator installed.  [This is currently in beta.](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2014/01/16/windows-azure-storage-emulator-2-2-1-preview-release-with-support-for-2013-08-15-version.aspx)
